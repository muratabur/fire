# arrears_balance

---

The **arrears_balance** is the difference between the amount of payments contractually due by the borrower minus the amount of the payments actually made by the borrower. Note that this should include [**accrued_interest**](https://github.com/suadelabs/fire/blob/master/documentation/properties/accrued_interest.md) up to the reporting date.

For UK, see [MLAR][mlar] Section F.2.2
