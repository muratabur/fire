The FCA defines a [**guarantee**][fca2] with regard to a securitised derivative product as

> "(1) (in relation to [securitised derivatives][secd]), either: (a) a guarantee given in accordance with [LR 19.2.2 R (3)][lr] (if any); or (b) any other guarantee of the issue of [securitised derivatives][secd]."

> "(2) (as defined in the [PD Regulation][PD]) any arrangement intended to ensure that any obligation material to the issue will be duly serviced, whether in the form of guarantee, surety, keep well agreement, mono-line insurance policy or other equivalent commitment."
